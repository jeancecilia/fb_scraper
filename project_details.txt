        - Number or Line sID

    - Rules/filters shall be predetermined

        1. If the author has published a post with other content within the last 7 days, then it should be filtered out. This post is not relevant. With other content means completely different content. 

        2. The keywords to be filtered out (i.e. if the post contains these keywords, it will not be extracted) are set by the admin beforehand. Not from the customer) I must be able to change this logic. 

        3. Profile Check: Does the Authors Profile include Keywords &gt; XYZ"This is predeterminate. If the post author includes in his user profile the keywords "Agent", "Real Estate", "Property", "Realtor" or any Combination or Longtail Keyword of that. Like "Real Estate XYZ"
